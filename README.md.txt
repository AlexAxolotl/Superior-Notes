# Superior Notes

Intended to make notes in a creative and friendly interface that engages with the user

---

## Platform

**Platform:** Website

## Usage

At the moment, Superior Notes is just an empty box where you can write text. It knows how to differentiate uppercase and lowercase letters with different colors.

I apologize for the lack of detail or information in this file. I wanted to start my project as fast as possible. With time, I will be updating everything. Please bear with me as I am a beginner.

The look and feel of this website will be futuristic.

I plan to implement different Note Blocks resembling the One Note format but with a modern touch. The blocks will feel as if they have low gravity and will be draggable. This will give you the feel that you are dragging a piece of paper into space. The blank space where the notes will be placed will be called "Boards."

Each Note Block will be modifiable, allowing users to adjust the height and width according to their needs. The color schemes will resemble space, and the note blocks will be styled similarly to Windows 11 22h2 default themes for the operating system, with a slight transparency.

In our case, we aim for more transparency and a modern, spacious look.

The interface will be minimalist and hidden until you place your cursor at the top of the page. Once you place the cursor on the board map, a mini preview of your current board will show. At the side, it will give you the option to create a new board with a transparent + button.

Customization controls for the user will be added in a modern and futuristic way.
